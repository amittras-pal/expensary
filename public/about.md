# Expensary

A simple-yet-powerful personal expense tracker. 

The application brings forth a simple budget based model of adding expenses across multiple categories to keep track of them. We are inspired from a stadalone no-distractions based approach to logging and managing expenses. It's minimal, and straightforward.

## Top Features

#### 1. 40+ Categories

The application comes preset with 40+ categories to segregate your expenses which are grouped into 6 parent categories that help you at a glance see where your money is going right on the dashboard.

#### 2. Budget Summarization

Your dashboard offers you a summary view of all the expenses you have added so far in your month, right down to the category level, so you know exactly where your money has been spent along with percentage share of each parent category...

You can also get a sum of specific categories to get an idea of how certain categories affect your expenditure at the toggle of a switch.

#### 3. Statistics

Your account comes with a powerful statistics module that makes historical analysis of your spending habits a breeze with interactive charts and graphs. It gives you a straightforward method of seeing how you have spent your money over the year at a glance.

_The stats views are planned to be upgraded in the future with more powerful features like caregory-wise breakdowns and analysis._

#### 4. Listing and Archival

The listing page offers powerful sorting and filtering controls for all expenses listed-by-month right from the first expense to the latest one in a calendar month. You can go back to the very first expense you created. 

#### 5. Search

**Trying to find something from long back??**

Try using the search functionality to find expenses by a matching words, or by one or more categories, or by a range of dates that you remember it was added on.

#### 6. Vacations & Plans

**There are times when you want to keep track of expenses that are not part of your monthly budget.**

_Worry Not!!_ Expensary offers you the power to create separate plans to group your expenses that you made when you went on that amazing trip or something like that. Plans come with the same level of control as on the regular expenses list but they're not counted as part of your regular budget.

_**P.S.:** You can also migrate expenses from the plan to your regular budget if you wanted to once you closed the plan..._

#### 7. Exporting expenses list and summary

**Do you want to crunch some numbers in excel?**

You can export your expense by month or dates range to an excel sheet that you can then use however you want.

#### Keyboard Shortcuts for Desktop

Keyboard shortcuts are available for all major actions in the application while on a desktop computer, fully utilizing the mighty leyboard. Explore them by tapping "i" anywhere while logged in.

**ON that note:** The application is accessibility compatible to make sure a smooth user experience with just the keyboard.
