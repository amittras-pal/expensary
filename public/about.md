# Expensary

A simple, powerful way to stay on top of everyday spending—without spreadsheets or distractions.

The app uses a clear budget-first flow so expenses are easy to add, organize, and review in minutes, not hours. It’s minimal by design, so the focus stays on decisions, not data entry.

See this month’s spend by category with shares and totals on a single screen—no digging required. Quickly toggle to combine select categories and understand what’s driving the bill this month.
