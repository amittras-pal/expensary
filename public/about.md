## Key Features

---

#### 1. 41 Pre-Built Categories

Choose from 41 ready-to-use categories organized into 7 parent groups (Entertainment, Finance, Food & Drinks, House & Utilities, Lifestyle, Travel, and Uncategorized). Your dashboard shows exactly where your money goes—at a glance.

---

#### 2. Dashboard Summary

See your current month's spending broken down by category with visual progress bars and percentage shares. Select specific categories to view combined totals and spot what's driving your monthly spending.

---

#### 3. Recent Transactions

Quickly access your most recent expenses right from the dashboard. Set your preferred editing window (5-25 days) to control how far back you can add or modify entries.

---

#### 4. Monthly Expense List

Browse all expenses for any month with powerful sorting and filtering. Apply filters by parent category and subcategory, clear them instantly with a keyboard shortcut, and see your filtered totals update in real-time.

---

#### 5. Global Search

Find any expense in seconds. Search by title, description, category, or date range—perfect when you need to locate that one transaction from months ago.

---

#### 6. Plans & Events

Track trips, events, and special projects separately from your regular budget. View your plans as a list or timeline, keep them open while active, and close them when complete. Each plan has its own summary and expense list.

---

#### 7. Recurring Expenses

Set up rules for expenses that repeat every month—rent, subscriptions, EMIs—and let Expensary create them automatically on the day you choose. Toggle rules on or off anytime, edit amounts or categories as things change, and spot auto-created entries at a glance with a subtle indicator on each expense card. Manage all your rules from Account Settings.

---

#### 8. Rolling Trends

See how your spending has shifted over the last 3 months to 2 years with a dedicated "Recent" view in Statistics. A chart plots your actual spending against your budget for each month, with clear year-change markers so you never lose context. Tap any bar to drill into that month's category breakdown, and open the quick-summary popover for a natural-language snapshot—total spent, average budget, how many times you exceeded it, and your highest-spending month.

---

#### 9. Export to Excel

Download detailed expense reports as Excel files. Export by custom date range, month range, or for specific plans. Choose whether to include the full expense list or just the summary—formatted and ready for deeper analysis.

---

#### 10. Personalization

Customize your experience with theme color selection, adjust your expense editing window, update your display name inline, and reset your password—all from a single Account page.

---

#### 11. Keyboard Shortcuts

Navigate faster with keyboard shortcuts for common actions. Press **I** to view all available shortcuts. Quick actions include adding new expenses (**N**), clearing filters (**X**), toggling category selection (**Shift+S**), and more.

---

#### 12. Welcome Landing Page

A clean, public-facing landing page introduces Expensary's key features at a glance before you sign in. Already logged in? You'll be redirected to your dashboard automatically.
