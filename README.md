# Expensary | Client App.

This is the React client application for a MERN Stack Application called `Expensary`. This is a simple application to track personal expenses.

The application is paired with the corressponding backend application which can be found [here](https://github.com/amittras-pal/money-trace).

### Environment

- `Node v18.0` or higher is required.

### Running Locally

- Clone the repository.
- Run `npm install` for the dependencies.
- Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the application with the following information.

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=<local_port_of_your_backend>
VITE_APP_TITLE=<app_title_for_header_title>
NODE_ENV=development
```

- `NOTE 1`: Make sure you have the backend application running too before running the frontend. Follow the steps to run the backed as mentioned [here](https://github.com/amittras-pal/money-trace#local-setup-for-development).
